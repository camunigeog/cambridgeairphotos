This is intended to be a definitive version of the lightweight Project
Light 'Apps' style as used by various UCS (and perhaps other) web
sites and applications.

The directories 'images', 'javascripts', and 'stylesheets' contain the
base assets needed to implement the style. These are typically
installed in the root of the relavent web site.

The directory 'examples' (and its sub directories) contain various
initial examples developed for particular applications. Note that
these are unlikely to correspond exactly to versions of the relavent
pages in actual use.

Bug fixes and enhancements should be commited to this version where
appropriate. However please try to keep changes to a minimum - each
change made here will need to be integrated into and tested on every
app that uses these styles. Changes also have the potential to break
other applications and so must be carefully tested and reviewed before
deployment.
