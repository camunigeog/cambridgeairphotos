<h1>Privacy and cookie policy for the Raven web authentication server</h1>

<p><a href="/">Raven</a> is a service used by some web sites to
identify people from the University so that access decisions can be
made based on user identity and related information. This policy
describes the personal information processed by the central servers
that form part of the Raven system, and explains how that information
is used. Other components of the Raven system operate on individual
web servers - you need to consult corresponding documentation from
these other sites to find out what they do with Raven-derived
information.</p>

<p>Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted on this page. It
was last updated on 28 May 2012.</p>

<p>Processing of personal information by the Raven server falls into
four categories: <a href="#response">authentication responses to web
sites</a>, <a href="#database">user database</a>, <a
href="#cookie">cookies</a>, and <a href="#log">log files</a>. These
are discussed in the following sections.</p>

<h2><a name="response">Authentication responses to web sites</a></h2>

<p>The Raven server's function is to identify individuals and to pass
information about them to web sites that request it.</p>

<p>The identification information passed to web servers includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>An indication of the status of an authentication request (success,
failure, cancelled, etc.) and possibly an explanatory message.</li>

<li>For the Raven/Ucam-WebAuth service, the user's identity expressed
as a Common Registration Scheme identifier (CRSid).</li>

<li>For the Raven/Shibboleth service, information about the user as
permitted by the <a
href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/raven/attribute-policy.html">Shibboleth
Attribute Release Policy</a>.</li>

<li>The date and time the response message was created, and optionally an
indication of when authentication should expire.</li>

<li>How the user established their identity.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="database">User database</a></h2>

<p>Anyone with a Raven account has an entry in Raven's user database - the
majority of people registered for any Computing Service system will have an
account on Raven. For each user, the information stored by Raven includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>CRSid*</li>

<li>Name and affiliations*</li>

<li>A non-reversibly-encrypted copy of the user's Raven password, and the date
and time it was last changed</li>

<li>Default login options and the date and time of their last change</li>

<li>Date and time of account creation, and cancellation if cancelled, and of
last successful login</li>

<li>A flag indicating if the user is known to have agreed to the IT syndicate
rules, and the time and location of such agreement if done via Raven.</li>

<li>For the Raven/Shibboleth service:
  <ul>
    <li>The date and time of first and last access</li>
    <li>The version number of the most recent Terms and Conditions
    accepted</li>
    <li>The list of attributes approved for release to each web site,
    the date and time of approval, and the version number of the Terms 
    and Conditions in force at the time</li>
  </ul>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Fields marked *, and account creation and cancellation, are derived
directly from the <a
href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/privacy/jackdawdatabaseprivacy.html">Computing
Service's Jackdaw database</a>. The information stored in the Raven
database is used for Raven's operation and for account administration
by members of Computing Service staff. Other that in the provision of
authentication responses as mentioned above, the information is not
otherwise disclosed by Raven.</p>

<p>Raven accounts are marked as cancelled when the corresponding user ceases 
to be entitled to a Raven account. Cancelled accounts are normally retained 
for about 200 days, after which the corresponding database records are deleted.</p>

<h2><a name="cookie">Cookies</a></h2>

<p>The Raven service uses two discrete sets of servers which perform
different, related authentication tasks. raven.cam.ac.uk serves the locally
developed Ucam-WebAuth components whilst shib.raven.cam.ac.uk is used to serve
components that follow the Shibboleth federation protocols. Websites may
choose to use one or both of these different technical solutions depending on
their specific authentication needs. Whilst the two underlying servers support
subtly different technologies, both are combined within the Raven service to
provide a consistent authentication experience to the end user.</p>

<p>Both Ucam-WebAuth and Shibboleth use a number of HTTP cookies. Precisely
which cookies are set depends on how the two underlying systems are
used. These cookies are set so that, if your browser is operating correctly,
they will be returned only to the server that set them and only over secure
HTTP connections.  The cookies that may be set are:</p>

<h3>Ucam-WebAuth Server (raven.cam.ac.uk)</h3>

<p>The Ucam-WebAuth server may set three cookies. The first two listed here
are essential for the operation of the Raven authentication service. The third
is set only if you choose to supply a default CrsID to offer when
logging-in.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Ucam-WLS-Session:</b> This cookie is used to implement Raven's single
  sign-on facility which enables you to move between many Raven protected
  sites without having to re-enter your login credentials for each site. It
  retains:

<ul>

<li>Your CRSid.</li>

<li>A record of your chosen Raven login options.</li>

<li>Your method of authentication.</li>

<li>The date and time of your most recent authentication.</li>

<li>The date and time of your session's scheduled expiry.</li>

<li>A cryptographic signature protecting the cookie value.</li>

</ul>

This cookie is set when you first authenticate by Raven in your browsing
  session and is deleted when either your browsing session ends or you log out
  of Raven. This feature can be turned off by visiting the Raven settings page
  at <a
  href="https://raven.cam.ac.uk/auth/account/">https://raven.cam.ac.uk/auth/account/</a>. If
  disabled this cookie is not set.</li>

<li><b>Ucam-WebAuth-Session-S:</b> This is used to separately control access
  to a small number of pages on the Raven server itself. It records:

<ul>

<li>Your CRSid.</li>

<li>The status of you most recent request to authenticate.</li>

<li>Your method of authentication.</li>

<li>The date and time of your most recent authentication.</li>

<li>The length in seconds of your current authentication session.</li>

<li>A unique value issued by the Raven server to identify the current
      authentication event.</li>

<li>A cryptographic signature protecting the cookie value.</li>

</ul>

It is set when you access the protected pages and is deleted when your
    browsing session ends.</li>

<li><b>Ucam-WLS-ID:</b> Sets a default CrsID to offer when logging-in. Set
  only on request, from the Raven account management page. This is a
  persistent cookie stored in your browser that expires after 1 year.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Shibboleth Server (shib.raven.cam.ac.uk)</h3>

<p>The Shibboleth server sets three cookies when it is invoked by a client web
site. These are all essential for the provision of the service.  All are set
when you first authenticate to a site using Shibboleth and will be deleted
when your browser session ends.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Ucam-WebAuth-Session-S:</b> This is used to manage your
  authentication to the Shibboleth server for onward transmission to client
  web sites using the Shibboleth federation protocols. It contains:

<ul>

<li>Your CRSid.</li>

<li>The status of you most recent request to authenticate.</li>

<li>Your method of authentication.</li>

<li>The date and time of your most recent authentication.</li>

<li>The length in seconds of your current authentication session.</li>

<li>A unique value issued by the Shibboleth server to identify the current
    authentication event.</li>

<li>A cryptographic signature protecting the cookie value.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><b>JSESSIONID:</b> This holds an alphanumeric value that uniquely
  identifies your current browsing session, this is used to further manage
  your authentication to the Shibboleth server for onward transmission to
  client web sites.</li>

<li><b>shib_sp_&lt;nnnnnnnnn&gt;:</b> It holds a numeric value which uniquely
  identifies your current browsing session, this is used to further manage
  your authentication to the Shibboleth server for onward transmission to
  client web sites.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you would like to find out more about Cookies and Privacy see <a
href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="log">Log files</a></h2>

<p>All accesses to the Raven server are logged for the purposes of system
administration, bug tracking, production of usage statistics and to trace
misuse. In the case of misuse relevant information may be passed to security
teams at other sites as part of an investigation. Otherwise the information is
not passed to any third part except as required by law, or as summary
statistics that do not identify individuals. Raw logfiles are normally kept
for no more than 6 months.</p>

<p>The exact information logged may vary from time to time but typically
includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Date and time</li>

<li>The user's identity if it has been established</li>

<li>Information provided by the origin computer, including hostname or
address, type of network client in use, resource or service requested</li>

<li>Information provided by the origin web server in authentication
requests, including the protocol version in use, the URL to which
response messages should be sent, an optional error explanation,
acceptable types of authentication, an optional web server parameter
string, the current date and time on the web server.</li>

<li>A record of the steps taken during the processing of requests</li>

<li>The information included in authentication responses as described above
under <a href="#response">authentication responses to web sites</a></li>

<li>Information allowing Shibboleth 'anonymous identifiers', such as
eduPersonTargetedID, to be associated with the authenticated user to
which they relate</li>

<li>The success or failure of requests</li>

</ul>
