<h2>About the collection</h2>

<p>The Cambridge University Collection of Aerial Photography (CUCAP) is the result of airborne survey campaigns which were started in 1947 by the pioneering JK St Joseph.  Since then the collection has grown to almost 500,000 images of obliques and verticals in black and white, colour and infra-red.  Virtually the whole of Britain has been covered, with the obliques depicting a wide variety of landscapes and features and the verticals being of survey quality, can be used in mapping projects.  Some of the uses of CUCAP images include; archaeology, geology, social history, law (land/border disputes), environmental issues (coastal erosion), planning as well as general interest.</p>

<p>The <a href="{$baseUrl}/"><strong>Online Catalogue</strong></a> provides a searchable database containing records of the vertical and oblique photographs acquired since 1945.  Although most of the collection covers the UK there are also several thousand images taken over Ireland (1951-73), NW France (1961, 1973/4), Denmark (1966-70) and The Netherlands (1970-73).  Enquiries regarding these images need to be made direct to the librarian as they are not yet available through the online catalogue.</p>
